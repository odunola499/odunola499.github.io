Hi, I'm Odunola, a Machine Learning Engineer at [Spi-tch](https://www.spi-tch.com/). At Spi-tch, we focus on making cutting-edge speech AI models—like speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and machine translation—accessible for African languages, empowering developers to build impactful solutions.

I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Ibadan, where I study Electrical and Electronic Engineering. My passion lies in signal processing, and I aspire to pursue a PhD in the field to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI and audio technology.

When I'm not coding or diving into a technical paper, you can find me reading a book, watching anime, or writing. I'm always exploring new ways to merge creativity with technology.
