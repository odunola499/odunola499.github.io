## Datasets

### **Sermon Pair**
- A curated collection of 932,000 rows of sermon transcripts derived from YouTube sermons, transcribed, split into passages, and meticulously hand-labeled to identify the final Bible passage mentioned.
- Built to power a machine learning plugin for EasyWorship, enabling automatic, real-time display of Bible passages during sermons without human intervention.
- Aimed at enhancing worship efficiency by streamlining the presentation process, though development is currently paused due to time and compute constraints.
